## Objective of the Laboratory
- Demonstrate **ethical automation** of reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning.
- Teach basic parsing of tool outputs to create actionable reports.
- Introduce the concept of **noise vs signal** in automated scans.
- Show manual traffic analysis to validate automated findings.
- Reinforce: **Never execute exploits** — only search and report.

## Rules of Engagement / Scope
- **Target machines**: Isolated lab VMs only (Windows Domain Controller + member server).
- **Attacker machine**: Kali Linux VM.
- **No production systems**, no internet-facing targets, no real exploits executed.
- **Explicit permission**: This lab is for personal/educational use in a controlled environment.

**DISCLAIMER**  
**This repository is for educational purposes in isolated lab environments only.**  
Do **not** use these scripts or techniques against any system without explicit written authorization. Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

## Environment Used
- Attacker: Kali Linux (latest)  
- Targets:  
  - 192.168.0.25 → Windows Server (Domain Controller – company.local0)  
  - 192.168.0.30 → Windows member server  
- Services exposed (intentionally/default): LDAP, Kerberos, WinRM, SMB, RPC, etc.
